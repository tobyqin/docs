```bash
# Windows
choco install kind

# Mac
brew install kind

# Create cluster
kind create cluster

# Delete cluster
kind delete cluster
```

If you cannot setup the cluster successfully, you can use the interactive shell in docs site.

## Plan B

We can use interactive tutorials to learn kubernetes.
